# PMD-Generator

How to use:

1. Get your desired tileset(s) for use.
	Many tilesets have been ripped for you already.
	https://github.com/PMDCollab/RawAsset/tree/master/TileDtef

    Be sure to use the ones with three sections: Walls, Floors, & Pools.
    But of course you could make your own and use them.
	  Just make sure they have the same layout as the ones at the above link.

3. Open the App.

4. Select your tilemap.
	The "Open Tileset" button.

5. Change the generation settings as you wish.

6. Generate Dungeon.
	Your generated dungeon shall be displayed.
	If it doesn't quite feel right, step back to step 4.

7. Save your dungeon map.
	It'll be saved in the same folder you place the app in.

	The saved image, will have its generation seed saved in its name,
	in case you really like the way a dungeon generates.
